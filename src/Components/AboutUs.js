        <p style={{ color: "white" }}> From our research we have procured that Agriculture in India is still being practised with
          traditional techniques which includes huge amount of time and human labour creating
          dependencies in their work.  Rapid growth in agriculture is essential not only for self-reliance
          but also to earn valuable foreign exchange. It is envisaged to make available relevant
          information and services to the farming community and private sector through the
          use of information and communication technologies and to supplement the existing delivery
          channels provided to hand in various modernized techniques and tools which are already been
          put through in many countries(like USA,France,UK, Australia etc.). This Farmersâ€™ Portal is an
          endeavour to create one stop shop for meeting all informational needs and methods
          relating to Agriculture.
